## Inspiration
Our inspiration for KanBoy came from our own studying habits of doing group sessions on Discord. However, we often got distracted and unfocused while we were trying to be productive. We made KanBoy to solve this problem.

## What it does
KanBoy is a Discord bot made for studying and productivity. The main feature of the bot is the Kanban Board project management tool built directly into the bot, so you and your peers never have to worry about forgetting to-dos. There is also a Pomodoro timer with a leaderboard to track who studies the most, a streaking system to help build habits, and an AI-powered chatbot for any questions that come up while studying.

## How we built it
We built KanBoy off of the discord.py library, and we made out website using the Bulma frontend framework.

## Challenges we ran into
At first, we struggled to make the Pomodoro feature track time, take points, and enter/leave calls. We also ran into problems when trying to resize the logo in the navbar because of how the Bulma framework overwrites CSS.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We take pride in that we made a project that we would actually use. We are also proud of the website's clean and user-friendly command documentation.

## What we learned
We learned the ins and outs of making a Discord bot with Python. We also learned how to make, design (with Bulma), and deploy a website on Vercel.

## What's next for KanBoy
We would want to upgrade the Pomodoro feature to have the bot stream the clock and other data live. We would also be interested in making a scheduling tool that notifies everyone at the same time for a study session.
